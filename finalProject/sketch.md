## My sketch

Theme: Mickey Mouse's Clock Cleaners.

It is based on an episode from Mickey Mouse, where he cleans the clock with Goofy and Donald. 

Here is a link to the episode (7-8 mins): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jIiL9ruJDA

The clock does not tell the time.

Here is a sketch of the clock:

#### Mechanisms

There are three mechanisms in this clock, divided amongst the three characters.

1. Mickey
  * Cleaning the number 1 with a mop.
