# Final Project Journal

My final project is going to represent my hobby, which is embroidery. The project will showcase a figure holding a needle and an embroidery hoop, and the motion of sticking the needle in the hoop and out, as if its sewing a thread. The way in which it will work with our clock, is that the action of sewing gets more and more intense by the hour, up untill threads start flying around. 

Here is a final sketch of the project as a whole (with a few explanations that I have added for myself):

## Progress of My work:


### Monday (6/April/2020)

Here is my intial sketch of the project and a few notes I had written down:

Here is my sketch after getting feedback from the Professor, and my peers on how to improve the linkage mechanism and replacing it with a cam mechanism:
I was not sure at this point how I could make threads fly around.

 ## Wednesday (8/April/2020)
 
After Monday's class. I felt that my cam mehcanism was way too complicated, and that having the head move up and down was pointless. Therefore, I recall that in one of our classes the Professor mentioned something about working with a servo motor to make an eye mechanism, and it made sense to me to add that instead.


Therefore, in these sketches I have drawn a new sketch of the project, how the eye mechanism will work, and dimensions of certain parts of the project:

 ## Monday (13/April/2020)
 
 During class, I received feeback from the Professor on how to use an easier eye mechanism with a servo motor. In addition to that, referring back to the book "Cabaret Mechanical Movement", where I found the u-shaped bracket that should be very useful for the cam mehcanism to work properly.
 
 Here are the sketches of the changes and the eye mechanism:

## Wednesday (15/April/2020)

I believe this is when I started working on my project through fusion, so that I could visualize it better, and see how the parts would fit together.

Here are screenshots of my process on fusion:

## Monday (20/April/2020)

By now I have added a few of the other elements of the project into my fusion design. By working a little bit on the box as a whole, and the cam mechanism in a seperate file to make sure that it worked.

Here are screenshots of my process then:

## Wednesday (22/April/2020)

After receiving feedback from the Professor on how the cam mechanism can be altered I made such changes. First was adding a slot in the arm where the cam follower can slide through to allow a smooth movement. Which, in turn, led me to making the cam follower on fusion. In addition, I added the bodies to the box in preperation for adding the cam mechanism next.

## Monday (27/April/2020)

I continue working on my fusion design, where I'm trying to add the cam mechanism to the box. However, at this point of the process I started to face some challanges with time and fusion. Fusion was not fully cooperating with me, where the cam mechanism did not move at all, although everything should fit into place and move accordingly.

Here is a screenshot of my process then (the cam follower not added to the box because it did not work):

## Wednesday (29/April/2020)

Due to some complications with fusion, where I felt that the software was slowing me down from actually completing the project. I opted for completing the project and visualizing it through sketches. Therefore, at this point of my process I was able to lay down some of the components that I needed like the fan, hub to connect the rod to the stepper motor, and dimensions of the cam follower. In addition to that, I was finally able to conceptualize how the eye mechanism would fit into the whole project and how I would add it.

Here are my sketches:

## Monday and Wednesday (4 & 6/May/2020)

Now that I had the basics of how everything would fit and work together, I was able to think about how the project would look like. Therefore, I worked on the hands, their dimensions and how they would hold things. In addition, I added a few extra information to the eye mechanism, like the dimensions of how and where it would be placed, and how it would work.

Here are my sketches:

## Monday and Wednesday (11 & 13/May/2020)

At this stage I was able to figure out what parts I wanted to 3D print or laser cut.


For some of the components that I wanted to laser cut, I had drawn the components, and the appropriate dimensions for them to be exported to a software and hopefully laser cut. 

For example, the right and left arm, the two bodies, and some components for the eye mechanism:

![](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/machineLab/blob/master/sketches/IMG-6329.JPG)
![](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/machineLab/blob/master/sketches/IMG-6327.JPG)

![](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/machineLab/blob/master/sketches/IMG-6330.JPG)


However, there are also other parts that I wish to laser cut, but their dimensions and infromation are already in my fusion design. 

For example, the platform that holds the fan:

![](https://github.com/FatimaAlmaazmi/machineLab/blob/master/sketches/Screen%20Shot%202020-05-14%20at%204.52.11%20AM.png)

On the other hand, the components that I wanted to 3D print, also have their information stored within the fusion design.

For example, the box as a whole (with the u-shaped bracket (although I'm not entirely sure that is possible)), the cam follower, the cam.

I was also able to think about how the components will be attached all together and what extra materials I would need to do so. 

The two bodies will be attached to the box by L-brackets.
The platform that holds the servo, will be attached to the body by L-brackets.
The platform that holds the fan, will be attached to the box by L-brackets.
The two arms will be attached to the bodies by 20mm bolts and knots.
The hub I will be using to connect the 8mm rod to 5mm stepper motor rod, is one suggested by the Professor (which I think can be 3D printed).
Ping pong ball.
Strings.
Threads.
Embroidery hoop.
Needle.
Servo motor.
Stepper motor.

Hopefully I have added all of the necessary information for making this project :) 

Thank you.
