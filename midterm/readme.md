## Midterm Project


For my midterm project I wanted to create a mechanism that produces sound, by using the stepper motor mechanism, the servo motor, and the arduino.

The theme of my project is *The Hunchback of Notre-Dame*.

Here is a skecth of what my project will look like:

### Stepper Motor Mechanism

I will be using the stepper motor mechanism as the cathedral. By using linkages, I will make a small figure move up and down to pull on a rope attached to a bell. However, this small bell will not make any sound. 
The movement of the linkage or the stepper motor will be controlled by a button.


Here is a skecth of the stepper motor mechanism and its dimensions:

### Servo Motor Mechanism

I will be using the servo motor mechanism to move Quasimodo's arm to hit the bell. I will be making a stand of sort that will hold the servo motor in place.
The servo motor will move in a 90 degree angle only. And, this will be controlled by a button.


Here is a sketch of the servo motor mechanism and its dimensions:

### Arduino

By using a speaker, I will be playing a short melody of the movie on repeat.

### What I have ready (physically)

I unfortunately did not get the chance to take pictures of the materials that I have ready for the project. Nor did I take pictures of how my project looked like.

I will list the things that I had ready, and what I was planning to do next:

**1. wooden base**
  
  I have a wooden base ready to place my mechanisms on. Here are its dimensions.

**2. linkages**
  
  Right before we left, I had planned to work on the linkages. I wanted to laser cut them from cardboard, because I felt it would be easier and faster.
I also planned to use Plastic Pop Rivets to attach linkages together. 

Here is a screenshot of the note I made on that day + Plastic Pop Rivets I wanted to use.

**3. placemnet**
 
 I also had the placement ready. I just needed to glue everything on the wooden base. Here is a sketch of how I planned the placements.

Thank you :)
