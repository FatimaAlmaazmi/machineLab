### My Fusion360 Midterm Project




I recreated the stepper motor mechanism that we did in class through Fusion360. I wanted to make it look exactly like the one I made and intended to use for my midterm project.


I started by making the first panel, and I completed that in class with the professor. By using the Parameter function, it was very easy to recreate the second panel. 

We also learned how to bring in some of the tools that we used to make the mechanism in class. Through Mcmaster-Carr, I was able to download the bolts, knots, gear, and the stepper motor. 

I made the 8mm shaft, by creating a cylinder.


To join all of these components together, I used the Joint function to do so. Although it was quite difficult to get used to, I got used to it. However, I am not sure if I joined them correctly or not.




Here are screenshots of my project:
