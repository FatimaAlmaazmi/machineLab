## My Fusion360 Midterm Project




I recreated the stepper motor mechanism that we did in class through Fusion360. I wanted to make it look exactly like the one I made, and intended to use for my midterm project.


I started by making the first panel, and I completed that in class with the professor. By using the Parameter function, it was very easy to recreate the second panel. 


We also learned how to bring in some of the components that we used in class. Through Mcmaster-Carr, I was able to download the  four bolts, and knots, the gear attached to the motor, and the stepper motor. 


To join all of these components together, I used the Joint function to do so. Although it was quite difficult to get used to, but it turned out okay. However, I am not sure if I joined them correctly or not.

I made the 8mm shaft, by creating a cylinder and attached it to the plane by using the Joint function.
